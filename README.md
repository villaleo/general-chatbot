# general-chatbot

A basic I/O chatbot I created during my senior year in high school
with two other individuals for AP Computer Science A (AP CSA). Utlizes
basic object-oriented topics introduced in AP CSA.

To run this program, you can copy the Chatbot.java and Chatbot_runner.java 
files and run them on your machine using a Java IDE.
